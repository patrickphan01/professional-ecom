# ecom-user

**User Service for the Professional E-Commerce Platform**

This microservice is dedicated to managing user-related functionalities within the broader [professional-ecom](https://github.com/phankieuphu/professional-ecom) ecosystem. Built with Go, it emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and clean architecture principles.([GitHub][1])

* **Middleware Integration**: Incorporates middleware for logging, authentication, and request validation.
* **Modular Architecture**: Structured into clear modules: `config`, `logger`, `middleware`, `models`, `routes`, and `services`.
* **gRPC API**: Exposes endpoints for user operations, adhering to REST principles.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: Go (Golang)
* **Frameworks/Libraries**: Standard Go libraries; potential use of third-party packages for routing and middleware.
* **Database**: Not specified; assumed to interface with a user data store.
* **Logging**: Custom logger module for structured logging.([GitHub][2], [IONOS][3])
